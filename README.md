# Raymarching Solar System for AICG class

## Description
This project is an interactive simulation of the solar system using raymarching techniques. Users can explore the solar system by moving the camera view with the mouse and zooming in and out. The simulation features four buttons that enhance the user experience:

- **Fond simple:** Switches to a simplified galaxy background.
- **Fond r√©aliste:** Offers a more detailed background but may cause a drop in FPS; use with caution.
- **Reset View:** Returns the camera to its original position.
- **Change Orbits:** Extrapolates the orbits of each planet for a more schematic representation.

## Features
- Interactive exploration of the solar system with smooth camera movement.
- Detailed textures and models for each planet.
- Background options to enhance visual experience.
- Camera controls for zooming and panning.
- Responsive design that works in modern web browsers.

## Prerequisites
- A modern web browser that supports WebGL.
- Internet connection (if using online resources for textures).
